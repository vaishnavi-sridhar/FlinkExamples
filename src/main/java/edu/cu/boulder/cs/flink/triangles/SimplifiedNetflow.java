 * http://vacommunity.org/VAST+Challenge+2013%3A+Mini-Challenge+3 
 * There are different formats for netflows, version 5 and version 9
 * are the most popular.  To represent those formats, likely another
 * class is needed.
 *
 * The samGeneratedId and the label fields came from the Streaming
 * Analytics Machine (github/elgood/SAM).  These don't come from
 * the netflow representation but are used by SAM internally.  I added
 * them here to compare directly with the SAM implementation.
